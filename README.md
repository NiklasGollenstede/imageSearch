Firefox (Google) reverse image search context menu addon:
Adds a context menu option 'Image Search for ...' to the page context.
Mouse-wheel-clicking or clicking while pressing 'Ctrl' will open the Images reverse search with the selected image in a new tab.
Left clicking or invoking the option otherwise opens the search in the current tab.
It finds Image elements, background images, ':before'/':after' images and images of elements covered by other elements.
Works with linked/online, local, firefox-internal and inline images sources.

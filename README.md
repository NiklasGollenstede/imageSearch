Firefox Google Image reverse search contect menu addon:
Adds a context menu option 'Google Search for (background) image' to the page context.
Mouse-wheel-clicking or clicking while pressing 'Ctrl' will open the Google Images reverse search with the selected image in a new tab.
Left clicking or invoking the option otherwise opens the search in the current tab.
Works with linked/online, local, firefox-internal and inline images.
